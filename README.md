**JavaScript Projects**

This repository contains two basic JavaScript projects: Memory Game and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Both projects are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects were created for learning purposes.




**Projects Overview**

**1. Memory Game**

The Memory Game is a classic game where the player needs to match pairs of cards. The game board consists of cards laid out in a grid face down. The player flips over two cards at a time trying to find a match.


**How to Play**
Open the index.html file located in the memory-game directory in your browser.
Click on two cards to flip them over.
If the cards match, they will disappear.
If they do not match, they will flip back over.
The game is won when all pairs are matched.

**2. Rock-Paper-Scissors**

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple game where a player competes against the computer. The player and the computer each choose one of rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is determined based on the rules:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock

**How to Play**

Open the index.html file located in the rock-paper-scissors directory in your browser.
Click on your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
The computer will randomly select its choice.
The result will be displayed showing who won the round.
